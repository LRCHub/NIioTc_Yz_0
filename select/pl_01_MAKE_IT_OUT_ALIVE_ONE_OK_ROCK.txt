Run away, run away, run away
You don’t know who to run from
Nowhere to go,
don’t wanna go, nowhere to go
No road is left to run on
I was born,I was born with horns
Demons couldn’t shake me up
Bring it on,
bring it on,bring it on
‘Cause we haven’t had enough
Won’t give up the fight
Make it out alive
Set this world on fire now
Wow (wow) wow (wow)
Don’t give up,
it’s gonna be alright
Cause I won’t let you burn out
Wow (wow) wow (wow)
We gotta make it out alive
Tonight, tonight, tonight
I’m screaming on the inside
I was trying to hide,
trying to hide, trying to hide
Not ready for this ride
Gotta face,
gotta face the unknown
It’s the only way to live
I’m ready to go,
ready to go, ready to go
Somewhere I’ve never been
Won’t give up the fight
Make it out alive
Set this world on fire now
Wow (wow) wow (wow)
Don’t give up,
it’s gonna be alright
Cause I won’t let you burn out
Wow (wow) wow (wow)
We gotta make it out alive
Make it out alive
Set this world on fire now
Wow (wow) wow (wow)
Don’t give up,
it’s gonna be alright
Cause I won’t let you burn out
Wow (wow) wow (wow)
We gotta make it out alive
Wow, oh yeah, oh yeah
We gotta make it out alive
Wow, oh yeah, oh yeah
We gotta make it out alive
