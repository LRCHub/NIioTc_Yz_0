Oh, my darling, tell me you love me
That you'll never walk away
'Cause you know I love you with a burning fire
And I'll love you 'til my dying day
When the times get hard and the road gets rough
I know with you, I'll have enough
When the storm gets dark and the lights go out
Take my hand and hold on tight
And I know we will make it out alive

Oh, my love, my sweetest friend
My love for you, it knows no end
It will not falter, it will not fail
I'll follow you down any trail

When the winter is cold, I'll be your fire
Wrap you up with a burning desire
The wind, it howls, no end in sight
Take my hand, and hold on tight
I know we will make it out alive

And when we're older and our hair turns gray
I know there will come a day
When our lives are over
And we have to leave
I'll follow you into eternity

And as we cross over to the other side
I know with you it'll be alright
And when we're gone and our families cry
You'll take my hand and hold on tight
I know we won't make it out alive

'Cause no one ever makes it out alive
