Nothing but red in the streets
Brink of collapse at our feet
When history starts to repeat, now, now
Consequences of a vision are piling up
Deep in a war of attrition, nowhere to run
Divide among the division, who can we trust, now

Cities are falling
Sky turning to black
Nation rests on our shoulders
One shot to take it back

Will you make it out alive?
Will you walk down the wire
Closing in from every side
Will you stare down the fire?
Will you make it out alive?
Will you make it out alive?
Will you make it out alive?

Chaos and riots begin
Our leaders gone with the wind
Enemies came from within, oh, now
Only ourselves as protection, we gotta fight
Cornered by enemy factions, nowhere to hide
If we could stop the infection, we gotta try, now

Cities are falling
Sky turning to black
Nation rests on our shoulders
One shot to take it back

Will you make it out alive?
Will you walk down the wire
Closing in from every side
Will you stare down the fire?
Will you make it out alive?
Will you make it out alive?
Will you make it out alive?

Will you make it out alive?

Cities are falling
Sky turning to black
Nation rests on our shoulders
One shot to take it back

Will you make it out alive?
Will you walk down the wire
Closing in from every side
Will you stare down the fire?
Will you make it out alive?
Will you make it out alive?
Will you make it out alive?
Will you make it out alive?
Will you make it out alive?
