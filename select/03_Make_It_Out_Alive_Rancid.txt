I drank water from a bloody creek
The only laugh I could find
I lost my leg in The Wilderness
And the fire made me blind

Charge up the hill on the Southern line
With grapeshot and bullets flying

Some of us didn't make it through
Some of didn't make it out alive
Some of us didn't make it through
Some of didn't make it out alive

You now rest in a pine-box
On a westbound train
Mr. Lincoln I have served you proud
And you didn't die in vain

The legends still got rest to do
Tomorrow the sun will rise

Some of us didn't make it through
Some of didn't make it out alive
Some of us didn't make it through
Some of didn't make it out alive

Charge up the hill on the Southern line
With grapeshot and bullets flying

Some of us didn't make it through
Some of didn't make it out alive
Some of us didn't make it through
Some of didn't make it out alive

Some of didn't make it out alive
Some of didn't make it out alive
Some of didn't make it out alive
