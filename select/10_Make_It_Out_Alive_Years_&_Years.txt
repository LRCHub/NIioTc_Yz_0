Starin' into lonely eyes
Starin' into my reflection
If all I know is hurt, I'd rather be high
I know it's gonna rain sometimes
Heaven doesn't make exceptions
I never thought I'd see a cloud in the sky

Promises that haunt my dreams
You're the storm that's hangin' over me (Oh yeah)

Every word twists like a knife
And I'm left here high and dry
I don't know if I'll make it out alive
And I'm pushin' it to the edge
'Cause I just want to forget
I don't know if I'll make it out alive

All I ever see is bluе
You are so hypnotisin'
The color of your eyеs, I'll never get over you
Maybe that's the way I was made
To hold on to the things that I can't change
I just wish I had the courage to see the truth

Promises that haunt my dreams
You're the storm that's hangin' over me (Oh yeah)

Every word twists like a knife
And I'm left here high and dry
I don't know if I'll make it out alive
And I'm pushin' it to the edge
'Cause I just want to forget
I don't know if I'll make it out alive

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (No, no)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (No, no)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Ah, yeah)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (No, no)
If I'll make it out

Every word twists like a knife
And I'm left here high and dry
I don't know if I'll make it out alive
